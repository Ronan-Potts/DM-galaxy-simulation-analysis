# Informing Searches for Dark Matter using Galaxy Simulations

This is a research project that I did in PHYS2921 at the University of Sydney. The goal was to inform haloscopic searches for dark matter by comparing results
from Milky Way-like galaxies to the standard galaxy model used to inform prior searches.
